### Hi there 👋 I'm [Devita Putri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devitaaptr/)
> Undergraduate Statistics Student | Machine Learning Bangkit 2022

<div>
 <p>
I am a Statistics student at Padjadjaran University who active in organizational activities, student activity units, committees, and volunteers. I have interests in data analysis and data science. The programming languages that I usually use to process data are R and Python. I have high motivation, a high desire to learn, adaptability, and a person who can be relied on in new things even when given the opportunity I will prove myself as a competent worker.
